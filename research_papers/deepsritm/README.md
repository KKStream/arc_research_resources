## Methods

- Before entering the network, the input LR SDR image $`I`$ is decomposed into the base layer $`I_b`$ and the detail layer $`I_d`$ using the guided filter (an edge-preserving low-pass filter).
    - [Guided Image Filtering](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6319316)
    - $`I_b`$ is computed by applying the guided filter to $`I`$, and then $`I_d`$ is obtained by simply dividing $`I`$ by $`I_b`$
    - $`I_d = I \oslash I_b`$
    - $`I_b`$ contains a blurred color image, dominant with low frequency information.
    - $`I_d`$ is mostly colorless, dominant with high frequency information.
- Our method takes 5.85 seconds and 5.05 seconds to generate a 4K frame for SF = 2 (scale factor) and SF=4, respectively, on an VIDIA TITAN Xp GPU.
- üë®üèº‚Äçü¶≤ no temporal consistency?
- We collected ten 4K-UHD HDR videos (BT.2020 with PQ-OETF) of 59,818 frames in total from YouTube.
