## Methods

- Deformable alignment is like
    - Step 1. Flow the features (optical flow)
    - Step 2. Do CNN on the flowed feature.
    - Step 1 + 2 ‚Üí One DCN cell (no offset diversity, 1/9 of the 3x3 kernel)
- DCN (Deformable Convolutional Network)
    - 9 (3x3) offset diversity.
    - If __N__ warped features are stacked ‚Üí __N__ offset diversity ‚Üí __N__ can be arbitary.
    - Decomposed to flow and CNN.
    - üë®üèº‚Äçü¶≤: __N__ warped features are like __N__-head?
- Increasing offset diversity increases the performance, but it saturates eventually.
- Increasing offset collects information for occluded areas.
